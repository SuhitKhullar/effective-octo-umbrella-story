John was sitting in the park and it was extremely hot. He asked himself if he should get a refreshing coconut or a strawberry ice cream.

The line behind the ice cream stand was long, and John was feeling impatient (it really was quite hot), so John bought a coconut instead.

John sat on a bench to enjoy his coconut, but all he could think about was how much he wanted that strawberry ice cream.

Therefore, John got up and started making his way to the ice cream stand.

The line was so long that by the time he had made it to the stand, the sun had begun to set, and it was no longer hot enough for him to want ice cream, so he quickly brought it home and saved it in the fridge for the next hot day.
